# Image-Classification-Project

The main goal ofthis projectis to develop a systemthat can identify
images of cats and dogs. The input image will be analyzed and then
the output is predicted.

• Used libraries - TensorFlow Keras models, TensorFlow Keras layers,Pandas, Matplotlib

• Used CNN to buid this model
