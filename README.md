# Image-Classification-Project

The main goal ofthis projectis to develop a systemthat can identify
images of cats and dogs. The input image will be analyzed and then
the output is predicted.


• Used libraries :- TensorFlow Keras models, TensorFlow, Keras layers, Pandas, Matplotlib

• Used Generators for converting large amount of data in batches.

• Used CNN to buid this model

• I used Batch Normalisation and Dropout
